#' @title Rename Population
#'
#' @description Rename any population that is not currently labeled as its applicable ESU or DPS
#'
#' @details When originally added to APPS some populations are not listed, such as 10j experimental populations, but later become listed or otherwise need to be considered part of a listed ESU or DPS. The Deschutes River steelhead Nonessential Experimental Population is one such population, which is considered part of the Middle Columbia River steelhead DPS. This function renames those populations so they group with the correct listed unit for calculations.
#'
#' @param df A dataframe of imported APPS data with an unaltered Population column
#'

# ***** takes a dataframe that already has the Population variable and updates the wording
# ***** for Population based on whatever equalities are listed in the recode() portion.
